## About

> Thanks for visiting my profile!

I'm Amitesh Tripathi, a passionate and dedicated Data Analytics Engineering Master's candidate at Northeastern University, Boston, USA, and an ex-professional from Capgemini. With a strong foundation in computer science from Rajiv Gandhi Technical University, Bhopal, India, I've honed my skills in data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

I bring to the table a blend of academic knowledge and over a year of hands-on experience in the industry. My expertise lies in Python, R, MATLAB, Java, C++, and JavaScript, and I'm proficient in data analysis tools like Flourish, DataWrapper, Tableau, and Power BI. I have a deep understanding of machine learning algorithms and have worked extensively with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Spark, and Hive.

At Capgemini, I implemented chatbot automation using PowerAutomate, reducing support tickets by a significant margin. I also executed over 200 SQL queries in Python to extract and update files to the database using MySQL and Oracle Database. At Aasmo Digital Pvt. Ltd., I contributed to the creation of a predictive model to identify potential returning clients, achieving an accuracy of 89% and resulting in a 20% increase in returning clients.

I'm not just about numbers and data; I'm about leveraging them to create real-world impact. I'm always eager to take on new challenges and opportunities where I can apply my data analytics skills to drive business growth and innovation.
